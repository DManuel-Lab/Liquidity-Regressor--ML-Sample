# Liquidity-Regressor--ML-Sample
Example ML Regression Algorithm build of a Liquidity Case Study

Scenario: A business is looking to understand how much liquidity to keep and would like to analyze available competitor data from databases like EDGAR and other 3rd party tools to get a sense of how much they should maintain at any given time. Since maintaining excess liquidity can be expensive or too low can result in bankruptcy territory. Analysis can be delivered to CFO or treasury teams and augmented with non-public information in order to make an enhanced decision. 

Data Framework: Notebook contains steps undertook in order to split data into training and testing sets, construct Machine Learning pipelines, perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validating alternative models to find the top performer.
